# Technology in Rojava
## History under Assad regime 
The Kurds are an ancient ethnic group with ancient origins. According to Kurdish sources, their civilization dates back 5000 years. Some self-evident Kurdish architecture still exists in the region. During the Ayyubid dynasty, they served crucial roles protecting Arab pilgrims to Mecca. Through these military roles, the Kurds spread from the Mediterranean to modern day Iran, and from Turkey to Lebanon. However, during the Ottoman empire, they were deported to Anatolia in modern Turkey, but eventually gained autonomy in the Raqqa region of Northern Iraq. With the defeat of the Ottoman empire and the Treaty of Sevres, Kurdistan was divided between the French Mandate (Syria), the newly formed Turkish Republic, the British Mandate of Iraq, and Persia (modern day Iran). Those borders mostly exist today. In Syria, the 1970s brought Arab nationalization to Kurdish regions. One hundred and forty thousand Kurds were deported to the desert, leaving their ancestral farmlands. Even the towns had their names Arabized. In 1986, on the Kurdish holiday,Newroz, 40,000 Kurds, in traditional dress gathered to celebrate the New Year. Since Kurdish identity, dress, and language had been outlawed in the Arabized Syrian regime, the gathering was declared illegal and the army fired into the crowd, killing four people. 

In 1991 after Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons against the Kurds, the Kurdish Republican Government of Iraq was granted autonomy from Baghdad following the years of protracted struggle and the US involvement during the Gulf War. Following the Tunisian Revolution, the “Arab” Spring of 2011, and the assassination of a prominent  Kurdish leader, Kurdish demonstrations became a routine part of the popular uprising. In July of the following year, the Kurdish National council declared its de facto autonomy and the Confederated States of Northern Syria were born. Today, the YPG, or people’s protection units, the armed wing of this new government, lead the fight against the Islamic State and are allied with the US coalition forces. As recently as March 2017, the UN Security Council rejected claims that the YPG was an anti-oppressive force, noting their multi-ethnic units, the strength of community-led democracy, and the lack of religious persecution.



## Brief overview of confederalism 

With the declaration of Kurdish (and then Arab, Yezidi, Assyrian, and Turkmen) autonomy in the region, neighborhood, village, regional, and national councils were set up to fill the power void and build a more inclusive system than the Arab Baathist regimes that surround them. A key proponent of this constitution is the ability to be educated in one’s native language. Despite the plethora of ethnic groups in the region, all Kurds, Arabs, Syrians, Armenians, Assyrians, and Turkmen people were educated in Arabic only. All other languages were declared illegal in both Syria and Turkey. 

This new paradigm is reflected in the governance structure of the new economy. Where people under the Assad regime were forced to grow monoculture wheat and disallowed from planting trees, the modern Rojava economy ensures that every family food, sugar, tea and fuel. A series of communes have sprouted up, promoting everything from education (University of Mesopotamia), sustainable agriculture, filmmaking, and even hydro-electric energy production. Amnesty International notes that, despite widespread conflict and starvation conditions in refugee camps in Iraq, people in the Confederated States are fed. It is graffitied everywhere: “There is hope in Rojava!” 

## Technology in the Confederated States

However, due to Assad-regime policies that forced Kurds to be farmers and the ongoing civil war, there is a substantial lack of expertise in any language. Most people privileged enough to have educations left when the fighting started and many of the infrastructure projects were staffed by either Western foreigners or the ruling Alawite minority. Western sanctions against the Assad regime to the West, Turkey’s demilitarized border and hostility to the Kurdish struggle to the North, political struggles with Iraqi Kurdistan to the East, and an ongoing fight with ISIS to the South mean that Rojava is isolated from the luxuries of modern manufacturing. 

 This has led to a significant gap in knowledge in the region. However, the internet is the world’s largest repository of information and can be accessed wirelessly. Where children in the West can youtube documentaries on quantum mechanics, build software on ubiquitous computers, and browse Wikipedia to their hearts’ content, Syrian children have no 
such luxuries. There are very few books printed in indigenous languages, and, with the collapse of of the Assad regime, public education (and Arabic education) has more or less ceased. Open-source knowledge repositories like Wikipedia, Khan Academy, and JSTOR, as well as the open-nature of internet protocols mean that education can happen remotely and everywhere. In addition, wireless networks have the ability to connect displaced families, promote democratic organization of resources, and allow people here to communicate struggles and triumphs to the outside world. There already exists Kurdish, Turkish, Armenian, versions of Wikipedia, meaning every child and adult can learn in their native language if only given access to the internet. While much smaller than the wikipedias for Western languages, translators, photographers, and content producers can be paid good wages for as little as $150 a month!

## The problems with traditional, hierarchical internet structures
Well, the bad news is that each region has made deals with separate internet providers. In Syria, there is a single provider, run out of Damascus, and controlled by Assad. Otherwise, internet is piped illegally across the Turkish border via Ubiquiti products and is both heavily censored and incredibly unreliable. Both Damascus and Istanbul have been criticized by reporters without borders for their hostility to a free press. Amnesty International notes that political organizing and opposition are met with imprisonment and torture. Syria’s internet infrastructure is based on 10 year old cellphone technology and data plans have only been rolled out to pro-Assad areas. Even where there is good access, it comes via European satellite providers and peaks at 3Mb/s of back haul--not exactly enough to split with a whole village. It also violates the economic sanctions and is incredibly illegal.

However, by rolling out wireless links from friendly regions in Iraq, we can connect millions of people to the internet for relatively little money. A gigabit connection, apportioned as in the US, can serve educational resources to 10,000 students for a few hundred dollars a month. Local servers, a couple hundred dollars a piece, can serve content locally, reducing reliance on foreign connections, and the infrastructure can be maintained by people making $150 a month. Using cheap, open source computers, we can build a computer labs for local schools at $100/student, giving them access to the internet, their course materials, and a brighter future. Unlike other foreign-based non-profits, this project is rooted in the community with cooperation from the National Economic Council and the National Education Committee, meaning that support comes the community and at the highest levels.
