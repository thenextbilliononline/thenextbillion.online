                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>Technology solves the problems of rich, white people. The only way to fix that is with an intersectional analysis. 
                <p>All human beings have a right to communicate freely, openly, and securely, regardless of their sex, gender, race, or class.
                <p>Technological liberation is rooted in grass-roots action, open source code, and the technologies to keep people safe, wherever they may be.
