#### Technology favors the rich

We see the world as fundamentally improved by technology. However, technology does not in itself solve problems. All too often, improvements for the richest facets of society do not reach the poor. Despite the ubiquity of smart phones in the industrialized world, more than 1/2 of the global population does not have even basic access to the Internet. As of 2016, [The International Telephone Union](http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2016.pdf), in it's annual report on the matter, showed that only 48% of the world has access to the Internet. As you might expect, that also falls along traditional lines of class, race, and gender. While 75% of Africans are unconnected to the 'Net, only 21% of Europeans are. Women are 12% more likely to be without access than men. Only 16% of people in less developed countries use the Internet while rural folks are almost twice as likely to be without access when compared to their urban counterparts.



#### Even good intentions reproduce the problem

To solve that, we have to think in ways that are anti-oppressive, intersectional, and explicitly aware of privilege. We can look to projects like One Laptop per Child which, while executed with the best of intentions, was unable to solve the crises of poverty. [The World Bank](https://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/one-laptop-per-child-is-not-improving-reading-or-math-but-are-we-learning-enough-from-these-evaluati) recognizes that despite 10s of millions of distributed laptops, giving children out-of-context technology does not improve their math or reading scores. Certainly, standardized test scores are not the end-all, be-all of education metrics, but they are all we have. The only thing that OLPC did improve was the children's engagement with technology. This is should be obvious--giving children computers makes them more familiar with computers. What it doesn't do, however, is change anything structurally.


### Guidelines

##### Code of Conduct
Racism, sexism, misogyny, transphobia, classism, and all other forms of discrimination will not be tolerated. We will ask you to leave the organization until such time as you apologize, grow up, and make amends.

#### Acknowledge your privilege
Do not take your skills for granted and explain every step. All of the documentation should be cross-platform, with every single step documented. While we seek to be comprehensive in our content, think of articles as short lesson plans rather than encyclopedia articles. The content should explain the technology without getting bogged down in technical details. Avoid the use of idiomatic language as this content will eventually be translated.

#### Each article should stand on its own
Every village, town, and city is different. Do not assume you know what is best for every situation. To that end, all code, technology, and documentation should function by itself. If people need to communicate to loved ones, they do not necessarily need to write documents. If they need to learn about radio waves--they do not necessarily need to know the underlying physics. That does not mean that information should know be available and a part of this project. It just means that we should limit the scope of each page or project to something easily digestible.


#### Wiki Articles
* The current editable wiki lives [here.](https://github.com/thenextbilliononline/thenextbillion.online/wiki) It is then moderated, edited and published on the website on an as-needed basis. 
* Wiki articles are for background-information, theory, and difficult knowledge related to technology.
* It is then moderated, edited and pushed to the website on an as-needed basis. 
* Wiki articles are for background-information, theory, and esoteric knowledge related to technology.
* Each article must be self-contained, but can certainly use previous topics as background information. Please just link this to background infromation using relative links.
* Because Wikipedia already exists and suffers from problems of jargon and requirements of technical expertise, our content must be understandabe to a new user of technology, who likely doesn't speak English as their first language.
