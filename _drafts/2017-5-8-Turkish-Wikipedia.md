# Wikipedia in Turkey

Wikipedia, the world's largest free encyclopedia and [example of the emergent productivity of swarms](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia), was blocked as of 8am local time April 29th, 2017 in Turkey. Whether that was because of claims that [Turkey has covertly trained, aided, and financed ISIS](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/29/turkey-pays-price-erdogan-blindness-to-isis-threat), Erdogan's long-time stance that the US-backed [People's Protections Units in Northern Syria are terrorists](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-33690060), or the controversial April 16th referendum that sealed his power with techniques [condemned by Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/03/20/turkey-crackdown-kurdish-opposition). However, one thing is certain-- shutting down free education is not something that open societies do.

## A little context

The Turkish state has long been at war with the Kurdish people who reside in the southeast of the country, a place divided even by name. The Turks call it Anatolia, a name with Greek origins while Kurds call it "Bakur", which is Kurmanji for Nortnern Kurdistan since [the partition of Kurdistan during the fall of the Ottoman empire](/Rojava), Kuridish has been an illegal identity in Turkey). As such, the PKK has waged a decades-long, bloody, and violent campaign against Turkey for autonomy in the region. Turkey alleges that the (mostly Kurdish) People's Protection Units (also known as the YPG) have explicit ties to this armed group opposed to the Turkish state. [Other NATO allies are not convinced](https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2017/04/turkey-blocks-wikipedia/524859/) and have continued to [arm](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/29/syria-us-arms-supply-kurds-turkey), [defend](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/world/middleeast/syria-kurds-isis-turkey.html?_r=0) and [fight alongside](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/world/middleeast/us-troops-syria.html?_r=0) the YPG's Kurdish and Arab militias in a mutual fight against the Islamic State.

## The Tech

Because the internet is merely a connected network of computers, it has always been possible to route around censorship. Tools like virtual private networks and Tor wrap your data in encrypted 'tunnels' that allow you to pretend as if your accessing the internet from somewhere else. Encryption ensures that nobody along that route can see your data.

 Other tools, like torrents and the [Interplanetary File System](ipfs.io) have arisen to allow people to share data, content, and files with each other directly without relying on central servers to hold the data. With the creation of Bitcoin, people allowed to transfer money without the authority of central banks or governments. In addition to the obvious fiscal benefit of Bitcoin, a new type of math became prominent - one that allows information to be verified as legitimate without trusting anyone in the network. That is the basis of IPFS.

At the same time, people noticed that the Internet itself was prone to faults of centralization leading to longer wait times, slower speeds, and infrastructure prone to widespread failure. Starting with Guifi.net, in Spain, a new type of Internet was born, allowing people to build networks for and by people instead of relying on corporate infrastructure. An experimental branch of this idea, called CJDNS, incorporates the newest technologies (like encryption and peer-to-peer networks) to build networks that are not only community-led, but resilient to attacks and outages.

## The Response

In the coming days, we will deploy these technologies on the ground in Turkey and get people access to the information that makes modern connectivity so vital. We will update this blog entry to reflect that.
